This is a mobile application called ‘Road To Safety’ which is used to prevent road accidents. The user can register and login using their credentials. As the application has a data related to accident prone locations, when a user begins driving or walking, they just click the ‘Start Journey!’ button in the app which leads to the application asking the user to grant location permissions. Once the permission is granted, the app continuously matches the person's location with the accident-prone locations in the database. If any of the accident-prone locations come within the range of 500 metres of that person, an in-app alert and device notification will be generated by the app that informs you that you are entering, passing through or exiting a dangerous area. This will help prevent possible accidents and make road journeys safer for all users.
